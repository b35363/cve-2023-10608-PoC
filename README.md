Simple Proof of Concept of the CVE-2023-0608 Vulnerability...

The summer season is a well-known vulnerability in many businesses. While your colleagues are enjoying their holidays, tanning their backs , who's going to look after the infrastructure! I've got the impression that being an Admin, CISO or CISO means missing out on a lot of things...  

Especially as, with the summer slump, it must be a long time to spend weeks waiting for an incident or preparing projects for September...

So why not take advantage of these times to brush up on your skills?

So if you're familiar with certain subjects such as Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Cybersecurity or even Blockchain, you should know that I've asked that you be able to benefit from advice and support even this summer!  

I don't do this very often, but Dappwork is offering a summer discount on all its audit, consultancy and support services. A little gift to help you prepare for the new school year 😊 

NB: The discount applies to contracts signed this summer, from 1 June to 31 August, I won't be cancelling the discount after this period for current contracts, don't worry.
